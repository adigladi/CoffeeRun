# CoffeeRun

Check out a runnig version of the app, made for mobile:

http://www.emildickson.se/coffeerun/

We wanted to create an application for mobile use that would enable people to order coffee and have others pick it up for them for a small fee. The idea behind this is that people sometimes wish they had coffee but for whatever reason can’t or don’t want to go out and get it themselves. At the same time people who currently have a few spare minutes and also would like to earn a little bit of extra money could easily provide this as a service using our app.
